## Start up your Raspberry Pi

Your Raspberry Pi doesn't have a power switch: as soon as you connect it to a power outlet, it will turn on. Notice that the Pi's micro USB power port has a longer flat side on top.

+ Plug a micro USB power supply into a socket and connect it to you Pi's power port.

You should see a red LED light up on the Raspberry Pi, which indicates that the Pi is connected to power. As it starts up (this is also called **booting**), you will see raspberries appear in the top left-hand of your screen.

## title: First-time startup with NOOBS

If this is the first time you're starting your Raspberry Pi with an SD card containing NOOBS, you will see the NOOBS installer. This software will walk you through installing the Raspbian operating system (OS).

+ When the installer has loaded, it will offer you a choice of which OS to install. Check the box for **Raspbian**, and then click **Install**.

+ Click **Yes** in the warning dialogue box, and then sit back and relax. The Raspbian installation process will take a bit of time.

+ When Raspbian has been installed, click **OK**. Your Raspberry Pi will restart, and Raspbian will then boot up.
