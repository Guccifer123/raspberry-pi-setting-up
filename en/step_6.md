## How to get help

If you are experiencing problems, there are lots of ways you can get help and advice, check out the [help section](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/) and the [troubleshooting guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/troubleshooting-guide/) on [raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org).

The [Raspberry Pi forum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums) is a great place to ask questions, including a [Beginners](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=91) section where you will be able to get support from the Raspberry Pi community.

Call out on [twitter](https://twitter.com) using the hashtag #rpilearn or submit a question on the [Raspberry Pi Stack Exchange](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/)

You could also attend a [Raspberry Jam](rpf.io/jam) and talk to people about their experiences and get some first hand help.
