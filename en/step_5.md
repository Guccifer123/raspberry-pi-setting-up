## Starting up your Raspberry Pi

Your Raspberry Pi doesnt have a power switch, as soon as you connect the power, it will turn on. Notice that the micro USB power port has a longer flat side on top.

+ Plug the power supply into a socket and connect it to the micro USB power port.

When you Raspberry Pi starts up (booting) you will see Raspberries appear in the top left of your screen.
