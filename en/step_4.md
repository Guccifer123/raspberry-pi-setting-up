## Connecting up your Raspberry Pi

Lets get everything connected

+ Check whether your Raspberry Pi already has an SD card in the slot at the underside, and if not, insert an SD card with Raspbian installed (via NOOBS). 

_Lots of SD cards will come inside a larger adapter, and you can slide the card out of this using the lip at the bottom._

+ Find the USB connector for your mouse, and connect the mouse to one of the USB port on the Raspberry Pi (it doesn't matter which one).

+ Connect the keyboard in the same way.

+ Look at the HDMI port on the Raspberry Pi — notice that it has a large flat side on top.

_Make sure your monitor is plugged into a wall socket and turned on._

+ Connect the monitor cable to the Pi's HDMI port — use an adapter if necessary.

_Nothing will display yet._

+ Connect headphones or speakers to the audio jack if you have them.

+ Use an ethernet cable to connect the ethernet port on the Raspberry Pi to an ethernet socket on the wall or on your internet router. 

_You don't need to do this if you'll be using wireless LAN or if you don't want to connect to the internet._
